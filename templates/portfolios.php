<h1>Art Portfolios</h1>
<p>This is a collection of art portfolios. Our art collection is divided into current, completed, planned, and award-wining projects.</p>

<p>The <b>Decorated Projects</b> section below is a collection of art that has won awards.</b> 

<p>If you would like to collaborate with us as an <i>artist-in-residence</i>, please review <b>Upcoming Projects</b> section. It is essentially a <i>call for entry / call for submission</i>. The curatorial plans submitted by artists like yourself are presented there. 

<p>Art projects that we are presently working on are categorized in the <b>Current Projects</b> section. Finally, all of our completed artwork has been categorized under the <b>Completed Projects</> section.</p>
